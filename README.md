MVC5AngularJsRoutingSPA
=======================

An MVC5 Application that uses AngularJS routing system and Gets and Posts Promises to MVC controllers

The application is intended to supply information on Angular Routing and to give a start with the interaction between promises in AngularJs and the Backend system.

The server side is implemented in MVC 5 and Web Api 2.

It can be interesting for people that want to have a skeleton with basic operations.

There is also a very simple implementation of Basic Authentication.

It is worth taking a look at it because the standard MVC routing system is overridden by the Angular Routing system.

The approximation of a Single Page Application.
